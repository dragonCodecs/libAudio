WMA:
	Hufman decode (need to get the hufman tables out of the libAVCodec WMA decoder)
	Glue the coeficients and exponents back together.
	Put the channels back into their original state from the MDCT encoding stage.
	IMDCT, seems like it's fairly easy to do.
	De-Window, this is addative and will recover the original data. We have to set up a bit-pool for this.
