What's new
==========

pr1.200_2 [2005.09.21]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - fixed a typing bug in the new C++ based interface, which caused
    wrong display of tags. Winamp5, dBpowerAMP, XMMS plug-ins, and CPP
    examples were recompiled (unfortunately, the Linux binaries were
    now compiled on Fedora Core 2, but you can recompile them on your
    system using the included scripts). Thanks to Andrea for reporting

pr1.200_1 [2005.07.24]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - fixed a problem with deallocation of tags in some situations,
    causing a crash when OptimFROG_freeTags is called

pr1.200 [2005.07.17]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - OptimFROG.h now uses PortableTypes.h and SystemID.h in order to
    have portable types and infrastructure
  - the library is now available also for Linux as OptimFROG.so
  - added OptimFROG_freeTags to release the memory allocated for the
    key and value pairs in the tags structure
  - added a C++ based interface OptimFROGDecoder.h, having greater
    flexibility and requiring less work for writing plug-ins
  - all type names were appended _t to avoid name clashes
  - backward compatible type names are defined as macros
  - there are two new examples for using the C++ based interface
  - small fixes and improvements
  - based on the OptimFROG internal engine version 4.510

1.100 [2004.04.21]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - not binary compatible with the 1.000e experimental version, the
    applications must be recompiled (without any source code changes)
  - fixed a problem where the file handle was not released when getting
    file information using the infoFile function. Thanks to Florian for
    reporting
  - fixed a problem where no error code was returned when the function
    decodeFile failed to write data, when disk was full
  - added two text fields, sampleType and channelConfig to the Info
    structure
  - updated the sample command line programs to have complete error
    checking, reporting and return codes
  - small updates to the foobar2000 plug-in. Thanks to Case for
    reporting and help
  - small fixes and improvements
  - based on the OptimFROG internal engine version 4.509
